### Hey there!

My name is Blake. I enjoy all things **programming** and going to **hackathons**.

I tend to write **Rust** nowadays for fun systems programming projects and I write **Python** for all of my **Machine Learning** work.

Here are some projects you may be interested in:

- [MonoDepthEstimation](https://github.com/danielzgsilva/MonoDepthAttacks) - Adversarial attacks on state of the art monocular depth estimation networks
- [Drop](https://github.com/xNul/drop) - A LÃ–VE visualizer and music player
- [Adversarial ML](https://github.com/xNul/adversarial-ml-projects) - A number of adversarial ML attacks
- [Multithreading Data Structures in Rust](https://github.com/xNul/multithreading-projects-rs) - A number of lock-less, lock-free, wait-free, etc data structures in Rust

- [heart.ai](https://devpost.com/software/heart-ai-rzsb76) - A remote platform for heart health and best overall VandyHacks hackathon project
- [Machine Learning Work](https://github.com/xNul/machine-learning-course) - A collection of some Machine Learning work
- [D&D Action Classification](https://github.com/xNul/dnd-nlp-action-classification) - Reducing the manual labor required in D&D
- [UCFParkingAgent](https://github.com/xNul/UCFParkingAgent) - Get UCF parking information hands-free using Google Assistant
- [NauticalNavAR](https://github.com/xNul/NauticalNavAR) - An award-winning AR mapping application for cruise ships

While I dabble in a lot of different areas like **Operating Systems**, **systems software**, **security**, **reverse engineering**, **computer vision**, **cryptocurrency**, **music visualization**, **databases**, and **bots**; I think my strengths and experience lie in **Machine Learning**, **Backend Development**, and where the two intersect.

I contribute to the popular [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) project and build useful [bots](https://github.com/xNul/among-us-discord-bot) for my friends. When I'm not dabbling in **reverse engineering**, I'm moderating **reverse engineering** communities.

I often attend **hackathons** and want to see more **hackathons** in the professional sector. Let's make them more than university or private company events!

Thank you to everyone who has taught me along the way and to the internet that has given me so much knowledge.
